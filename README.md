# JavaScript Console-Finances

## Description

This project was created to demonstrate my skills as a JavaScript beginner. This project takes data that has already been provided and sorts it into manageable information for the end user.

Along the way I learn't a lot of the basics within JavaScript and how to use things likes loops to iterate through data to target specific items and other pieces of data.

## Usage

Go to the landing page, right click and click on 'inspect elements'. Once the inspector pops up, click on the 'console' tab and once you're in there, you can see the console-finance project.
